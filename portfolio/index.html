      <h3>My Extra Activities</h3>
      <p>
        During my extracurricular activities, I participated in basketball,
        volleyball, and cricket. I attended every parent's day and took part in
        group dances. Additionally, I was a member of a dance group that gave a
        farewell to the seniors. I also joined the FOZ club, which stands for
        Friends of the Zoo, where we fed the animals at the zoo. In high school,
        I was a member of the Interact Club, where I volunteered regularly.
        Currently, in university, I participate in volunteering for various
        university events.
